SimKit is intended to be built as a library on all platforms. Furthermore, it's
intended to be built as a shared library on platforms which support it. When
building SimKit as a shared library, you should declare "SIMKIT_EXPORTS" when
compiling. When building SimKit as a static library, you should declare
"SIMKIT_STATIC". When using SimKit, you should declare neither.

Source files are in the "src" directory. All builds of SimKit should include all
of the source files in this directory. Subdirectories refer to specific optional
features that SimKit can support on particular platforms. For example, the
"opengl" folder contains source files for SimKit that allow for rendering on
OpenGL. To use these files, you should add the source files in this directory to
your SimKit build, and declare a preprocessor macro named after the directory,
i.e. "OPENGL".

Includes are in the "include" directory. Add that directory to your include path
when compiling SimKit or any software that links with SimKit. The subdirectories
of the "include/simkit" directories work the same way as the source directories.

To use SimKit in your programs, simply include the SimKit header:

    #include <simkit.h>

To use things declared specific to an optional module, e.g. the OpenGL renderer,
include both the SimKit header and THEN the headers for those optional modules:

    #include <simkit.h>
    #include <simkit/opengl.h>

Note that including both headers will make this source file dependent on those
modules, and the underlying platform functionality therein. Therefore, you
should structure your program similarly to SimKit, such that files that require
a particular module are only built if that module is available in your build of
SimKit as well as the underlying platform.

SimKit has a number of required and optional libraries:

    SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf, versions 2 are requred
        (currently, only available from their mercurial tree)
    Freetype is required to build, due to SDL_ttf.
    Any of libpng, libjpeg, libtiff and libwebp are optional
        (not linking them will mean those formats will be unavailable)
    zlib is required to build libpng and certain modules of Freetype.
        (libpng provides it by default,
         you may want to build yours separately if multiple libraries use it)
