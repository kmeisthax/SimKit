 == SimKit: A realtime 3D graphics framework (aka "game engine") ==

SimKit is a game engine of sorts designed to be able to make C++ gamedev
slightly less of a hair-pulling nightmare. It provides a number of useful bits
of code for:

 * Managing gameloop time across fixed and variable timestep simulations
 * Tracking performance of your application
 * Structuring a game scene in a renderer-agnostig fashion
 * Caching loaded resources in memory 
 * Reference counting
  (because in 2013 C++ still doesn't ship a memory management solution
   more complex than "the implementation MIGHT have a GC")
 * And more as development continues

The main version of this library will be available under Git source control at:
   git://github.com/kmeisthax/SimKit.git

See the "UPSTREAM" file for more information.

This software is made available under Free Software licensing.

This software is designed to be built as a library, and integrate with other
Free Software libraries, most notably SDLv2, which is a compile-time dependency.
